JikesPG was originally released under a license specific to both the Jikes compiler
and JikesPG. That license was later replaced the by the IBM Public License. The
Eclipse License is derived from the IBM Public License, so there is a direct path
from the original Jikes License, the first open-source license drafted by a Fortune 10
corporation, to the widely-used Eclipse License.
